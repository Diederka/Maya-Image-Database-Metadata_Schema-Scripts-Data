The OAI-API can be used for harvesting and reusing the metadata of the Maya Image Archive. 
Its software ConedaKOR spawns four OAI-PMH endpoints for entities, kinds, relations and relationships:
https://classicmayan.kor.de.dariah.eu/api/oai-pmh/entities?verb=Identify
https://classicmayan.kor.de.dariah.eu/api/oai-pmh/kinds?verb=Identify
https://classicmayan.kor.de.dariah.eu/api/oai-pmh/relations?verb=Identify
https://classicmayan.kor.de.dariah.eu/api/oai-pmh/relationships?verb=Identify
Please refer to the OAI-PMH specification for further information on available verbs and on how to use them.
The api will retrieve entities and relationships according to the authenticated userâ€™s permissions. Kinds and relations are available without authentication. Please check out Authentication for how to use an api key.
Two formats are available: oai_dc and kor. While the former is only maintained to fulfill the OAI-PMH specification, the latter gives full access to all content within the ConedaKOR installation. According to specification, you must choose the format like so metadataPrefix=kor as a request parameter. The kor format adheres to a schema that is included in ConedaKOR. It can be found at
